# Bootloader

For custom frimwares who can't boot with U-Boot

## NOTICE

This is only made for custom frimwares. Use U-Boot for standard frimwares or non-native devices

U-Boot is a recommended safer option for OrchidOS. Orchid Bootloader is just a back up incase U-Boot dosen't work in your frimware
