# OpenOrchid
OpenOrchid is a LFS operating system with the Orchid official coat of paint and Electron-powered web interface on it. Open source for anyone to use!

## What's Orchid?
We make open source like Mozilla but our open source products don't look and work like trash.\
We are basically Mozilla if Mozilla wasn't a anti-user failure that's getting milked dry by a PHAT BEITCH!

## Why Electron?
Use the new B2G and compare it with OpenOrchid and you will see why.\
The B2G ones arent just less capable, more barebones but perform WAY worse cuz they lack our Orchid optimizations ;\)\
Also their backward compatibility is significantly worse and they constantly break, crash and ave inconsistent javascript errors.\
I could use B2G but the B2G builds of OrchidOS was so darn hard to code for and ontop of that, it looked like poo-poo-bam-beh.\
B2G OrchidOS is so awful it makes OpenOrchid look like Apple quality. and OpenOrchid already looks like Apple quality. lol\

I guess the new B2G is more meant for paranoid open source nerds than actual novice end users. And that shows.

## Details
This is the user interface and experience of OrchidOS (OpenOrchid) contained and packaged as a simulator in your desktop or a installable Linux user interface.

Basically like ASOP but for OrchidOS. A open source OS you actually want and like.\
Not one you use cuz its forced upon you with hypocrite privacy company ads (Like Brave Ads, they say no ads when their own browser is trying to get people scammed with crypto with forced non-optional notifications)... And the constant begging and nagging even when you specifically ask "Don't show again" like Mozilla does ALL the time.

We are not like Mozilla and won't be affected by woke bosh or greed bosh.\
At least we dont lie or fake anything. We actually care for our users and constantly listen and look out for them...\
UNLIKE MOZILLA!!!
