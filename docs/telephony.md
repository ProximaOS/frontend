# Telephony API Module Documentation

The Telephony API module provides functions to simulate telephony actions such as making calls, receiving calls, and logging call-related information. This documentation offers an in-depth explanation of each module function, its purpose, and how it can be used effectively.

## Introduction

The Telephony API module emulates telephony actions and call-related operations. It allows you to simulate call initiation, hang up, and logging of call information within the OrchidOS environment.

## Module Functions

### `call`

Initiates a simulated outgoing call.

```javascript
call(number: string): void
```
- number: The phone number to call.

This function simulates an outgoing call and logs the call information, indicating that an outgoing call is in progress.

### `hangUp`

Simulates hanging up a call.

```javascript
hangUp(number: string): void
```
- number: The phone number of the call to hang up.

This function simulates hanging up an ongoing call and logs the call information, indicating that the call has been received and ended.

### `callListener`

Listens for incoming calls and executes a callback function.

```javascript
callListener(callback: () => void): void
```

## Usage Example

```javascript
function main() {
  TelephonyAPI.call('1234567890');
  console.log('Calling...');

  TelephonyAPI.callListener(() => {
    console.log('Incoming call detected.');
    TelephonyAPI.answer();
  });
  console.log('Listening for incoming calls...');

  // Simulate a call being received and hung up
  setTimeout(() => {
    TelephonyAPI.hangUp('1234567890');
    console.log('Call hung up.');
  }, 3000);
}

main();
```

This usage example demonstrates how to interact with the Telephony API module. It showcases simulating call initiation and hanging up a call.
