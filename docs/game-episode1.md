(somber music)

**Interrogator**
Okay. Lemme read your rights: You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used in the court of law.

Now let's get to the point. I'll be on your side and i'll make sure you don't get sentenced for manslaughter. Okay?
Now what has happened yesterday?

[camera does a bokeh focus effect and pan to character]

**Unknown Person (You)**
(exhale) Well. Let's say there's that one dude who came completely out of nowhere. Like... We have no clue where he came from.

When we saw him. It was pretty obvious he was a murderer. So we tried to run away, call 911, etc. All no to avail.

**Interrogator**
You tried to call 911?

**Unknown Person (You)**
Mhmm...

**Interrogator**
And also. How did the supposed murderer so you say looks like?

**Unknown Person (You)**
Well. I wasn't really focusing on him because we were more worried about our lives than looking on him and he hides in the dark for some weird reason.

But i did see clothes similar to a normal person's clothes just with dried blood on them.

**Interrogator**
Huh... Where were you guys when he appeared?

**Unknown Person (You)**
We were in a big random park at the west of this town just having our time together while drinking and celebrating our job pay raises.

Also where's my friends at?

**Interrogator**
They're getting investigated to get more detail about the incident. They're alright. Just a bit shook up.

[camera zooms at character and seamlessly transitions into the time where they were at before incident]

**Unknown Person (You)**
I'll explain everything in detail.

**Chloe**
Did you guys hear about Ethan's promotion?
